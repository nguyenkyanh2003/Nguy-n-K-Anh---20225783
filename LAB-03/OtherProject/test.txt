Elon Musk is often referred to as Iron Man – a superhero capable of doing extraordinary things. However, all the extraordinary things he has achieved are not thanks to any supernatural powers but rather the result of his personal efforts. On January 8, 2021, Elon Musk surpassed Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world, with his net worth reaching a record-breaking $188.5 billion, which was $1.5 billion higher than Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, according to Business Insider.

Over the past year, Musk's wealth has increased by more than $150 billion – the fastest wealth increase in history – thanks to Tesla's stock surging over 700%. Not only does he head Tesla, but Elon Musk is also the CEO of SpaceX, the founder of The Boring Company, and a co-founder of OpenAI and Neuralink… It seems there is nothing in the world that Elon Musk cannot do.

However, not everything has been easy for Elon Musk. To hold a fortune worth over $202 billion (according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index on February 10, 2021) and become the richest person in the world, Elon Musk has experienced a lot of "bitterness, sweetness, and challenges" along the way.

Difficult School Years for Elon Musk

Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His father, Errol Musk, was an electromechanical engineer, and his mother, Maye Musk, was a nutritionist and also a professional model who had appeared on the cover of Time magazine.

After his parents divorced in 1979, Elon Musk, who was 9 years old at the time, along with his younger brother Kimbal Musk, decided to live with their father. "It wasn't a good idea," Elon Musk once shared in an interview with Rolling Stone about the decision to live with his father.

From a young age, Elon Musk showed a love for reading and a passion for programming, according to CNBC. In 4th grade, he almost spent all of his time reading the Encyclopedia Britannica, instead of playing like other kids.

Musk’s time at school was not easy. He was bullied to the point of needing hospitalization and was even thrown down a flight of stairs and beaten until he lost consciousness.

However, this did not stop him from achieving extraordinary things. In 1983, at just 12 years old, Elon Musk sold a simple game called Blastar to a computer magazine for $500. Musk described it as “a trivial game… but better than Flappy Bird.”

After graduating from high school, Musk moved to Canada to live with his mother, sister Tosca, and younger brother Kimbal.
